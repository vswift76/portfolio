			<p>Hello! I am just getting started on my front end web development journey. I have a few project sites under my belt
        showing off my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills and my photography hobby. Scroll down to see a few examples of my work,
        clicking on the images will take you to the project sites.

          <p>This project came from my first Code Louisville class, front end web development. This picture is one of my favorite pics I've ever snapped of Avatar
            bassist Henrik Sandelin during the Jan 2018 Louisville KY show, during the song 'Raven Wine', hence the project title.

          <p>This project came from my second Code Louisville class, Javascript. This picture is one I snapped just before the AVATAR show in Lexington, KY Sept 2019. 
            This was our last AVATAR show before the covid19 lockdowns. We very much miss our concerts and our concert friends.

                  <p>
                    Wife, Mother, Sagittarian, Dragon, I am all of that and more. By night, I work for a local Amazon FC. Inbound is my home department, but I'm crosstrained 
				all over the building so I never know where I'll end up throughout the night. During the day, when I'm not catching up on my beauty sleep, 
				taking care of my three kids (my husband totally counts, he said so himself, so that makes 3) and the two cats, I'm learning how to be a front end web 
				developer. I also admin a FB fan page for the Swedish metal band Avatar. I am quite well known as dressing up as AVATAR's vocalist Johannes Eckerström 
				for shows and have given myself the title of Lady Gin Swift, Bard of the Freakshow. I also stream on Twitch from time to time, you can watch me yell at games 
        or when my husband and I get with our group of friends and stream during what we call the Metal Meal Meltdown, a weeklong stream marathon raising money for St. Jude
        Children's Research Hospital (more info can be found on my Raven Wine project) I am wrapping up a Javascript class through Code Louisville right now, 
        this is my second Code Louisville course (the first being front end web development) I am currently trying to decide my next Code Louisville course, 
        leaning toward maybe taking a full stack Javascript course.
